# Pylox implementation
This project is a Python implementation of the well known book written by Robert Nystrom [Crafting Interpreter](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Pylox command installation
You can add the pylox.bat file into your environment variable path to simulate a language command line call.

## Objectives :
I'm following the book step by step and trying to figure out how to implemente the Java code I see in Python.
I try to stay using the same implentation tricks to be able to efficiently re implemente and understand the code books.

I want to complete the Java implementation in the book of Lox language to make sure that I can make my own interpreter and language using Python.

So, after this book I will try to create a new language by myself, re implementing some unefficient parts such as error handling
and make sure that I understand correctly the way that a high level interpreter works.

## Current stages :
- [ ] Evaluating Expressions
- [ ] Statements and State
- [ ] Control Flow
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Resolving and Binding
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Inheritance
